    Kensington Metropark has been a favorite place to visit since my childhood. It has a farm center, beaches, and nature trails.
    The nature trails are populated with cranes, wild turkeys, and smaller birds that will feed from your hand.

        <p>I have visited several National Parks but my favorite is the Black Canyon of the Gunnisor National Park in Montrose Colorado.
            Hiking the trails and viewing the Black Canyon from one of the trail peaks is breath-taking.

        <p>The team won the regional title in my senoior year. It was a honor to run at the state championship at Michigan International Speedway in 2021.
            I still photograph the team at a few of their races.
