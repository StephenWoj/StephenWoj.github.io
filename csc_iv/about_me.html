<h1>About Me</h1>                
<article>
<p>I’m Stephen Wojtanowski, a Computer Science major at Madonna University in Livonia, Michigan.
Livonia is my hometown where I live with my two sisters and my pet dog. I attended Catholic schools for 13 years. 
Through the Catholic League Organization, I started running cross country and track and field in fourth grade. My team was CYO champions in 2017.
 My high school team was regional champions in 2021.</p>

<p>Like most young adults, I love playing video games and watching movies. Most of the time, I eat healthy, but Buddy’s Pizza is my favorite carryout and chocolate chip cookies are my number one treat.
Besides running, I enjoy nature hikes. During COVID, Kensington Metro Park Nature trail was an escape from being inside. The chickadees will eat bird seeds right out of your hand.</p>
<p> With my family I have visited Dinosaur National Monument and Park, Hanging Lake, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Brice National Park, and Mt. Charleston in Nevada.
     Every year we travel to Empire, Michigan and stay in the heart of Sleeping Bear National Park. 
     I also walked across the Mackinaw Bridge, which connects Michigan’s lower peninsula to the upper peninsula, in 2015.
My travels include Florida where I visited Walt Disney World, Lego Land, Sea World, and saw a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral. 
In Nevada, I walked the main strip in Las Vegas through the arcades and interesting hotels. 
In Michigan, I visited most of the Metro Parks, cider mills, museums, The Detroit Zoo, Historic Fish Town, and Mackinaw Island.
